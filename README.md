# Keyboard
A brand new way of deeply ergonomic slim keyboard design - HW &amp; SW

# Preliminary requirements
* selection from different variants
* both parts
    * wireless
    * wired (wire spool)
* some fixture/handle to fix both parts together in a space-saving manner
* backlit
* anti-slippery stands (perhaps sucking disks)
* maybe water-proof

# TODO
* think of a better name for this project (hints: ergo, ergonomic, slim, portable, ...)

# Links
* Apple keyboard mod to NKRO + teensy: http://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1067
* how to remove the old yellowish tint: http://retr0bright.wikispaces.com/
