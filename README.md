# Keyboard *hw_kbd*
A brand new way of deeply ergonomic slim keyboard design - HW &amp; SW

# Preliminary requirements
* selection from different variants
* both parts
    * wireless
    * wired (wire spool)
* some fixture/handle to fix both parts together in a space-saving manner
* backlit
* anti-slippery stands (perhaps sucking disks)
* maybe water-proof

# TODO
* think of a better name for this project (hints: ergo, ergonomic, slim, portable, ...)
* contact Mr. P. Jakoubek, Mr. D. Kolibáč, and Mr. L. Hejkal regarding the plastic parts of scissor switches (injection moulding into a steel/aluminium mold?)
* choose a fitting HW license (similar to MIT and CC BY-SA 4.0)
